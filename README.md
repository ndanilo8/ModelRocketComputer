# Model Rocket Computer
[ARCHIVED] - I'm no longer revising this code. Drop me an email if you have any questions with the current code.

Just an Arduino that records rocket's telemetry with apogee detection for parachute deployment (pyro charges)
I will be adding code, schematics, photos and will fix some code that was commented out

Nevertheless, this code is Flight-Ready!

Coded in Arduino IDE
Used an Arduino Nano V3,
MPU6050 (IMU),
BMP085 (Barometric Sensor)
