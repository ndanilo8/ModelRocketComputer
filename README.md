# Model Rocket Computer
Just an Arduino that records rocket's telemetry with apogee detection for parachute deployment (pyro charges)
I will be adding code, schematics, photos and will fix some code that was commented out

This is the newest code, thus is still being written. NOT FLIGHT READY (yet ;) )

Coded on Visual Studio Code
 - MCU: Seeeduino XIAO,
 - IMU: MPU6050,
 - Barometric Sensor: BMP388
