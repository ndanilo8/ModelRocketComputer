# Model Rocket Computer
Just an Arduino that records rocket's telemetry with apogee detection for parachute deployment (pyro charges)
I will be adding code, schematics, photos and will fix some code that was commented out

Nevertheless, this code is Flight-Ready!

Used an Arduino Nano V3,
MPU6050 (IMU),
BMP085 (Barometric Sensor)
